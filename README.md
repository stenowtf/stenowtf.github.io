Hello, my name is **Stefano** and I live in **Bologna**, where I work full time as a **front-end developer**.

My day-to-day work activities consist of taking care of and improving a pretty cool e-commerce platform written in C# and **JavaScript**.

In my free time, I have recently started studying the **Erlang** language.

Among other things, I am passionate about:

- the Open Web,
- learning things,
- and consuming media.
