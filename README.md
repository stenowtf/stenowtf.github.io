# [steno.me](http://steno.me/)

Hello, my name is **Stefano** and I live in **Bologna**, where I’m working full time as a **front end developer**.

My day-to-day work activities involve taking care and improving a pretty cool e-commerce platform written in C# and **JavaScript**.

Recently, in my own time, I have started studying the **Elixir** language.

Among other things, I am passionate about:

-   the Open Web,
-   learning things,
-   and consuming media.
