## Hello,

My name is Stefano and I live near Bologna, where I work full time as a Software Developer.

My day-to-day work activities consist of building and taking care of e-commerce related tools written in JavaScript.

In my free time, I usually study functional programming.

Among other things, I am passionate about: the Open Web, learning things, and consuming media.
